n Linux, file access permissions are used to control who can read, write, and execute files. These permissions are set for three different types of users: owner, group, and others. Each user type has specific permissions that determine what actions they can perform on a file.

There are three basic permissions for each user type:

Read (r): Allows a user to view the contents of a file or directory.

Write (w): Allows a user to modify the contents of a file or create, rename, or delete files in a directory.

Execute (x): Allows a user to execute a file (if it's a script or executable) or traverse (navigate) a directory.

The three user types are:

Owner: The user who owns the file. The owner can modify the permissions of the file and is the user who created it.

Group: Files can belong to a specific group, and users who are members of that group inherit the group's permissions. This is useful for collaborative work.

Others: All other users who are not the owner or in the group fall into this category.

The permissions for each user type are represented as a combination of the letters r, w, and x, or as octal numbers (0-7).

Here's a brief overview of the possible permission combinations:

rwx: Read, write, and execute permission.
rw-: Read and write permission.
r-x: Read and execute permission.
r--: Read-only permission.
-wx: Write and execute permission.
-w-: Write-only permission.
--x: Execute-only permission.
---: No permissions.
Additionally, Linux uses the chmod command to change file permissions, and chown and chgrp commands to change the ownership and group of files.
